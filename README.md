    In the project first a webpage interface is displayed in which there is text of game
    name and directions on how to play. There are two buttons used one is for submit and
    the other is for reset which has the same respective names. Every time user submits 
    a guess interface displays the suggestion whether the number is higher or lower than the 
    predecided number. In this way the suggestions are given either till the answer is guessed
    correctly within thegiven tries or till the end of tries.
    Every submission of the guess from the user is recorded and displayed down the section.
    And also after every try remaining tries number decreases on the interface. Webpage will
    only take digits and none other characters.For any character enterd there will be a alert
    which reminds to enter a vaid number and also the range of numbers are specified, therefore
    digits outof the range are also not accepted and the alert is raised.

    different colour properties like color,background-color, position properties like sticky,
    static etc... Many classes, id's, imports, references are also used. Java script is used
    for the functional and interactive part. Many variables were used.Functions were created.
    Arrays were used to dispay the tries of the user in a linear sequence mode. if,else-if,
    for loops are also used. Event listeners and event handlers are used.Alerts are aslo used to
    display the rejection of out of limited range of input.
